This repository provides my personal plugin scripts for weechat.

- newsbar.pl         Writes highlights and other news into a bar
- query_blocker.pl   Simple blocker for private messages (i.e. spam), prevents
                     opening of buffers on undesirable private messages (/query, /msg)
- filter_ext.pl      Quick help against spam, extend /filter with prefixes for
                     following args: del, enable, disable, list

- sample_script.pl   This script can print help and changelog either started
                     from perl or as plugin script within weechat
- mplex.pl           Simple remote control of multiplexer, checking of
                     detach/attach (TMUX, GNU screen). Optional: setting of the
                     appropriate away status, executing of 3rd party script
                     commands, emitting Signals if multiplexer state has
                     changed.
